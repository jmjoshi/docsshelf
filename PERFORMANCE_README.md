# Performance Optimization Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the performance optimization features implemented for DocsShelf based on the roadmap requirements.

## 1. Flipper Profiling Setup

### Metro Configuration

- Added `metro.config.js` with Flipper integration for Expo
- Configured for both iOS and Android development
- Includes error handling for when Flipper is not available

### Dependencies

- Installed `react-native-flipper` for development profiling
- Metro config automatically detects development environment

## 2. Lazy Loading Implementation

### Database Pagination

- Added `getDocumentsByUserPaginated()` method to `DatabaseService`
- Added `searchDocumentsPaginated()` for efficient search
- Page size set to 50 documents per request
- Includes total count and hasMore flag for infinite scroll

### Document Service Updates

- Updated `DocumentService` to use paginated methods
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing non-paginated methods

### UI Implementation

- Modified `DocumentsList.tsx` to use pagination
- Implemented infinite scroll with `onEndReached`
- Added loading states for initial load and "load more"
- Debounced search with 300ms delay
- Performance monitoring for load and search operations

## 3. Memory Optimization

### Performance Monitor

- Created `PerformanceMonitor` utility class
- Tracks operation timing with start/end timer methods
- Monitors memory usage with `logMemoryUsage()`
- Integrates with Flipper for development profiling

### Memory Management

- Automatic memory monitoring after document loads
- Memory usage logging for search operations
- Placeholder for garbage collection triggering

## 4. Battery Efficiency

### Battery Optimization Utilities

- Created `BatteryOptimizer` class for battery monitoring
- Placeholder for battery level detection
- Framework for optimizing performance based on battery level
- Methods for reducing background tasks when battery is low

### Memory Optimization

- Created `MemoryOptimizer` class
- Methods for clearing unused data
- Memory threshold monitoring (warns at 70MB usage)
- Framework for optimizing image loading

## 5. Performance Testing

### Test Scripts

- Added performance test script in `package.json`
- Created placeholder performance tests in `__tests__/performance.test.ts`
- Includes tests for:
  - Document loading performance (< 2s)
  - Search performance (< 500ms)
  - Memory usage (< 80MB)
  - App launch time (< 1.5s)

### Low-End Device Testing

- Added script for testing on low-end devices
- Framework for battery drain monitoring
- Performance profiling commands

## 6. Key Features Implemented

### Battery Optimization

- ✅ Framework for battery-aware performance
- ✅ Methods to reduce background tasks
- ✅ Device capability detection
- ✅ Performance recommendations

### Profiling Tools

- ✅ Flipper integration via Metro config
- ✅ Performance monitoring utilities
- ✅ Memory usage tracking
- ✅ Operation timing

## 7. Usage Instructions

### Running Performance Tests

```bash
npm run test:performance
```

### Memory Monitoring

```bash
npm run profile:memory
```

### Low-End Device Testing

```bash
npm run test:low-end
```

### Flipper Profiling

1. Install Flipper desktop app
2. Start the app with `npm start`
3. Flipper will automatically connect for profiling

## 8. Performance Benchmarks

Based on technical requirements:

- **Memory Usage**: Target < 80MB
- **App Launch**: Target < 1.5s
- **Document Load**: Target < 2s
- **Search**: Target < 500ms for 10k documents
- **Battery Drain**: Target < 5% per hour idle, < 10% heavy use

## 9. Future Enhancements

- Implement actual battery level detection
- Add image compression and optimization
- Implement background task management
- Add more detailed performance metrics
- Integrate with device performance APIs

## 10. Monitoring

The app now includes comprehensive performance monitoring:

- Operation timing
- Memory usage tracking
- Battery optimization triggers
- Flipper integration for detailed profiling

All performance optimizations are designed to maintain the <80MB memory target while providing efficient document management for up to 10,000 documents.
