# Android Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Missing expo-modules-autolinking**: Fixed by running `npx expo prebuild --platform android --no-install`
2. **React Native Reanimated version incompatibility**: Fixed by downgrading to `react-native-reanimated@~3.3.0`
3. **Android SDK version mismatch**: Fixed by updating `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` to 34
4. **expo-camera compilation errors**: Fixed by downgrading to `expo-camera@~13.4.0`
5. **react-native-gesture-handler compilation errors**: Fixed by downgrading to `react-native-gesture-handler@~2.12.0`
6. **react-native-safe-area-context and react-native-screens errors**: Fixed by downgrading to compatible versions

## Quick Fix Commands:

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd "c:\Users\Jayant\Documents\projects\docsshelf"

# Clean install dependencies
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Fix dependency versions for Expo SDK 49 compatibility
npm install react-native-reanimated@~3.3.0 --legacy-peer-deps
npm install expo-camera@~13.4.0 --legacy-peer-deps
npm install react-native-gesture-handler@~2.12.0 --legacy-peer-deps
npm install react-native-safe-area-context@~4.7.0 react-native-screens@~3.22.0 --legacy-peer-deps

# Remove existing Android folder and prebuild
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force android -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npx expo prebuild --platform android --no-install

# Update Android SDK versions in android/build.gradle:
# Change compileSdkVersion from 33 to 34
# Change targetSdkVersion from 33 to 34
# Change buildToolsVersion from 33.0.0 to 34.0.0

# Clean and build
cd android
.\gradlew clean
cd ..
npm run android
```

## Root Cause:

The main issue was that you were using newer versions of React Native libraries that were designed for newer React Native versions (75+), but your Expo SDK 49 project uses React Native 0.72. This created compilation incompatibilities.

## Solution Strategy:

Downgrade all React Native dependencies to versions that are compatible with Expo SDK 49 and React Native 0.72.
