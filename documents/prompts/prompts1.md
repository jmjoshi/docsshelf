- **Tagging & Smart Organization**: Auto-tagging using AI, manual tags, and smart folders based on document context.
- **Bulk Actions**: Upload, move, delete, and share multiple documents at once.
- **Versioning**: Document version history and rollback.
- **Offline Access**: Full access to documents and features without internet; syncs securely when online.
- **Rich Previews**: Inline previews for PDFs, images, and text files.
- **Customizable Dashboard**: Widgets for recent documents, storage usage, security status, etc.

#### Device & Storage

- **Local-Only Storage**: All documents stored locally on the device; no cloud storage unless explicitly enabled by user.
- **Encrypted Backups**: Option to create encrypted backups to external drives or user-selected cloud providers.
- **Device Binding**: Option to restrict access to registered devices only.

#### Sharing & Collaboration

- **Secure Sharing**: Share documents with other users via encrypted links, with expiry and access controls.

jmjoshi: what is the ideal tech stach\k for a mobile application for apple and android phones

GitHub Copilot:

jmjoshi: @agent Try Again

GitHub Copilot: For a robust, secure, and scalable mobile application targeting both Apple (iOS) and Android devices, the ideal tech stack is:

### Cross-Platform (Recommended)

- **Framework:** Flutter (Dart) or React Native (JavaScript/TypeScript)
  - Both allow a single codebase for iOS and Android, fast development, and rich UI.
- **State Management:** Provider, Riverpod (Flutter) or Redux, MobX (React Native)
- **Networking:** Dio (Flutter), Axios/Fetch (React Native)
- **Local Storage:** SQLite, Hive (Flutter), MMKV, AsyncStorage (React Native)
- **Encryption:** Platform-specific libraries (e.g., flutter_secure_storage, react-native-keychain)
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth, Auth0, or custom OAuth2/MFA integration
- **Internationalization:** flutter_localizations, i18next (React Native)
- **App Store Integration:** In-app purchase plugins (e.g., in_app_purchase for Flutter, react-native-iap)
- **Testing:** Flutter Test, Jest/Detox (React Native)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Bitrise, or Codemagic

### Native (if needed)

- **iOS:** Swift (UIKit/SwiftUI)
- **Android:** Kotlin (Jetpack Compose)

### Backend (if required)

- **API:** Node.js (Express), Python (FastAPI), or Firebase Functions
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Firebase Firestore
- **Cloud:** AWS, Google Cloud, or Firebase

This stack ensures high performance, security, internationalization, and easy deployment to both app stores.

jmjoshi: This app will run completely native on mobile and the documents will be stored locally in a local storage encrypted at rest and in transit. what is the tech stack for this

GitHub Copilot: For a fully native mobile app with local, encrypted document storage (at rest and in transit), the ideal tech stack is:

---

### iOS (Apple)

- **Language:** Swift
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI (modern) or UIKit
- **Local Storage:** Core Data, SQLite, or FileManager
- **Encryption:** CryptoKit (for AES, RSA, etc.), Keychain for credentials
- **Networking (if needed):** URLSession with TLS 1.3
- **Biometric Auth:** LocalAuthentication framework (Face ID, Touch ID)
- **Internationalization:** Native iOS localization tools

### Android

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI Framework:** Jetpack Compose (modern) or XML layouts
- **Local Storage:** Room (SQLite), EncryptedSharedPreferences, or direct file storage
- **Encryption:** Android Keystore, Cipher (AES, RSA), SQLCipher for encrypted SQLite
- **Networking (if needed):** OkHttp/Retrofit with TLS 1.3
- **Biometric Auth:** BiometricPrompt API
- **Internationalization:** Android native localization tools

---

This stack ensures maximum performance, security, and native experience, with all documents stored and encrypted locally on the device. No third-party cloud or cross-platform frameworks are required.
