jmjoshi: check the milestones - **Milestones**:

- Functional app shell with navigation.
- Passing basic tests (unit tests for utilities).
- Documented setup instructions in README.md.

GitHub Copilot: Based on my review of the project, here's the status of the Phase 1 milestones from the roadmap:

### ✅ Functional app shell with navigation

- **Status**: Achieved
- **Details**: The app has a well-structured navigation setup using React Navigation. App.tsx integrates Redux, Redux Persist, React Native Paper, and SafeAreaProvider, then renders `AppNavigator`. The navigator includes:
  - A root stack navigator that switches between auth and main flows based on authentication state.
  - An auth stack with Login and Register screens.
  - A bottom tab navigator for the main app (Home, Documents, Settings) with icons from Expo Vector Icons.
- This provides a functional shell with proper routing and state-based navigation.

### ❌ Passing basic tests (unit tests for utilities)

- **Status**: Not achieved
- **Details**: The **tests** folder exists but only contains a `.gitkeep` file (no actual test files). Running `npm test` confirms: "No tests found, exiting with code 1". While Jest is configured in package.json and testing libraries like `@testing-library/react-native` are installed, no unit tests have been written yet.

### ❌ Documented setup instructions in README.md

- **Status**: Not achieved
- **Details**: There is no README.md file in the project root. The only README.md files found are in subfolders (e.g., README.md), but these contain feature documentation, not project setup instructions. A root README.md with environment setup, installation steps, and usage guides is missing.

### Recommendations

- To complete the remaining milestones, consider:
  - Creating a README.md in the root with setup instructions (e.g., Node.js version, `npm install`, `npm start`).
  - Adding basic unit tests for utilities (e.g., in utils) using Jest and `@testing-library/react-native`.
- Once these are addressed, Phase 1 can be marked as complete. Let me know if you'd like help implementing any of these!
