I have successfully implemented the UI/UX Polish section from the roadmap document. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## âœ… **Implemented Features**

### 1. **React Native Paper Integration**

- All screens now use React Native Paper components (Card, Button, TextInput, etc.)
- Consistent Material Design styling across the app
- Proper theming with high-contrast colors for accessibility

### 2. **Haptic Feedback**

- Added `react-native-haptic-feedback` library
- Implemented haptic feedback for:
  - Button presses (`impactLight` or `impactMedium`)
  - Success actions (`notificationSuccess`)
  - Error states (`notificationError`)
- Provides tactile feedback for better user experience

### 3. **Progress Indicators**

- Added loading states to buttons during async operations
- Upload and scan buttons show loading spinners and text changes
- Login button shows loading state during authentication
- Visual feedback prevents multiple rapid clicks

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**

- Replaced Alert dialogs with Snackbar components for better UX
- Non-blocking error messages that auto-dismiss
- Color-coded snackbars (error vs success)
- Maintains app flow without interrupting user

### 5. **Responsive Layouts**

- Used `Dimensions` API to detect orientation
- Adaptive layouts for portrait/landscape modes:
  - Button containers switch between row/column layout
  - Font sizes adjust based on orientation
  - Proper spacing and margins for different screen sizes

### 6. **Accessibility Features**

- Added comprehensive accessibility props:
  - `accessibilityLabel` for screen readers
  - `accessibilityHint` for action descriptions
  - `accessibilityRole` for component types
  - `accessible={true}` for interactive elements
- High-contrast theme with improved color ratios
- Screen reader support for all interactive elements

### 7. **Theme Configuration**

- Custom theme with high-contrast colors
- Better color accessibility compliance
- Consistent theming across all components

## **Screens Updated**

- **Home Screen**: Added quick action buttons, responsive layout, accessibility
- **Documents List Screen**: Progress indicators, snackbar errors, haptic feedback, responsive design
- **Login Screen**: Loading states, haptic feedback, accessibility, better error handling

## **Key Improvements**

- **Performance**: Loading states prevent UI blocking
- **Usability**: Haptic feedback and progress indicators improve user feedback
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant with screen reader support
- **Responsiveness**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages without app disruption

The implementation follows the technical requirements from the documents, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards and providing a polished, professional user experience. All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow React Native best practices.
