jmjoshi: check in code in github with summary and list of components added, updated

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you check in your code to GitHub with a comprehensive summary. Let me first examine the current state of your repository to understand what changes have been made. 

Read changed files in [](file:///c%3A/Users/Jayant/Documents/projects/docsshelf)

Let me check the git status and changes in your repository: 

Ran terminal command: git status

Now let me get a diff of the key changes to understand what components have been added or updated: 

Ran terminal command: git diff --name-status

Let me check what the latest changes are by examining the diff of the main App.tsx file and key components: 

Ran terminal command: git diff HEAD~5..HEAD --stat

Let me now create a comprehensive plan for committing the changes with a proper summary: 

Created 5 todos

Starting (1/5) *Stage all changes for commit*

Now let me start by staging all the changes: 

Ran terminal command: git add .

Starting (2/5) *Analyze key components and changes*

Let me analyze the key components and changes by examining some main files: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/Jayant/Documents/projects/docsshelf/App.tsx)

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/Jayant/Documents/projects/docsshelf/FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md#1-1), lines 1 to 31

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/Jayant/Documents/projects/docsshelf/src/components/common/StorageStatus.tsx#1-1), lines 1 to 31

Ran terminal command: git status --short

Starting (3/5) *Create comprehensive commit message*

Now I can see there are many files staged. Let me create a comprehensive commit message and commit the changes: 

Ran terminal command: git commit -m "feat: Major DocsShelf application enhancements and Android setup
