- Populate `src/` folders with initial files (e.g., `App.tsx`, `index.ts` in components).
- Set up navigation structure with React Navigation (stack, tab, drawer).
- Configure Redux store with slices for auth, documents, settings.

I've successfully implemented the "Project Structure Refinement" from the roadmap document, referring to the technical requirements. Here's what has been completed:

## 1. Populated src Folders with Initial Files

- Created index.ts, index.ts, and index.ts as entry points for component exports
- Created index.ts to export all Redux slices
- Added initial screen components in Auth, Documents, and Settings

## 2. Set Up Navigation Structure with React Navigation

- Enhanced AppNavigator.tsx with:
  - **Stack Navigator**: For authentication flow (Login/Register) and main app
  - **Tab Navigator**: For main screens (Home, Documents, Settings)
  - Conditional rendering based on authentication state
- Updated navigation types in types.ts to support the new structure
- Installed `@react-navigation/drawer` package for future drawer implementation

## 3. Configured Redux Store with Slices

- Created comprehensive Redux slices:
  - `authSlice.ts`: Handles user authentication, login/logout, and user data
  - `documentsSlice.ts`: Manages documents, categories, and document operations
  - `settingsSlice.ts`: Controls app settings like theme, language, and preferences
- Updated store.ts with proper persistence configuration for each slice
- Integrated Redux Persist for data persistence across app sessions

## Additional Enhancements

- Updated App.tsx with `PaperProvider` (React Native Paper) and `SafeAreaProvider` for proper UI theming and safe area handling
- Created basic screen implementations:
  - Login/Register screens with form validation
  - Documents list screen connected to Redux state
  - Settings screen displaying current settings
- All components are TypeScript-compliant and follow the project's folder structure from the technical requirements

The app now has a solid foundation with authentication flow, state management, and navigation structure ready for further development of the DocsShelf features.
