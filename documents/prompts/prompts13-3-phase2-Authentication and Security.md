## Summary

I have successfully implemented the **Authentication and Security** features for Phase 2 of the DocsShelf mobile app as specified in the roadmap. Here's what was accomplished:

### ‚úÖ **Implemented Features**

#### 1. **Authentication and Security** ‚úÖ

- **Login/Signup with Email/Password**: Implemented secure user registration and login with strong password validation (12+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- **Biometric MFA**: Integrated React Native Biometrics for fingerprint/face ID authentication
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Implemented end-to-end encryption for data at rest and transit using CryptoJS
- **Audit Logging**: Set up comprehensive audit logging with local SQLite storage

#### 2. **Key Components Implemented**

**üîê Encryption Service** (index.ts)

- AES-256-CBC encryption/decryption
- PBKDF2 key derivation from passwords
- Secure key storage using React Native Keychain
- Device keystore integration

**üóÑÔ∏è Database Service** (index.ts)

- SQLite database setup with user tables
- Audit logging table for security events
- Document metadata storage
- Secure user data management

**üîë Authentication Service** (index.ts)

- User registration with validation
- Secure login with biometric support
- Password strength enforcement
- Audit logging for all auth events

**üíæ Storage Service** (index.ts)

- Encrypted file storage using RNFS
- Secure document upload/download
- File metadata management

#### 3. **Updated UI Components**

- **Login Screen**: Added biometric authentication option
- **Register Screen**: Enhanced with password validation and secure registration
- **App Initialization**: Integrated AuthService initialization

#### 4. **Security Features**

- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: All encryption keys managed locally
- **Secure Key Storage**: Device keystore for encryption keys
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of user actions
- **Password Security**: Strong hashing with PBKDF2 and salt
- **Biometric Integration**: Optional MFA with device biometrics

#### 5. **Updated Documentation**

- **README.md**: Added comprehensive authentication and security setup guide
- **Code Documentation**: All services fully documented with TypeScript interfaces

### ‚úÖ **Technical Implementation Details**

- **Database**: SQLite with proper schema and migrations
- **Key Management**: React Native Keychain for secure storage
- **Biometrics**: React Native Biometrics for device authentication
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### ‚úÖ **Quality Assurance**

2. UI/UX Polish
3. Database and State Management enhancements
4. Performance Optimization

The app now has a solid security foundation with end-to-end encryption, biometric authentication, and comprehensive audit logging, meeting all the requirements specified in the roadmap and technical documentation.
