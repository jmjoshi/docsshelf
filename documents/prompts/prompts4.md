jmjoshi: what is the best tech stack for this (refer documents/requirements folder and subfolders for requirements ) mobile app for apple and android phones, the app should store documents strictly locally.

GitHub Copilot: Based on the requirements outlined in the requirements folder (including prd.md, loginprd.md, and the enhanced subfolders like device_storage.md, document_management_experience.md, security_compliance.md, performance_scalability.md, sharing_collaboration.md, internationalization_accessibility.md, and legal_compliance.md), the app is a cross-platform mobile document management tool focused on **strict local storage** (no mandatory cloud), end-to-end encryption, OCR scanning, biometric/MFA authentication, offline functionality, secure backups, and compliance with standards like GDPR/CCPA. It must handle file uploads, categorization, search, versioning, previews, and local sharing (e.g., NFC/QR), while optimizing for performance, accessibility, and battery efficiency.

### Recommended Tech Stack

For a mobile app targeting iOS and Android with these constraints, I recommend a **cross-platform framework** to minimize development effort while ensuring native performance and access to device features (e.g., camera, biometrics, file system, external storage). The stack prioritizes local-first architecture, security, and scalability.

#### 1. **Framework: React Native (with Expo or CLI)**

- **Why?**
  - Cross-platform (single codebase for iOS/Android), reducing development time by ~50-70% compared to native Swift/Kotlin.
  - Strong support for native modules (e.g., camera, biometrics, file encryption, external device backups via USB/SD).
  - Mature ecosystem for document handling, OCR, and encryption libraries.
  - Meets performance requirements (e.g., <1.5s launch time, <80MB RAM usage) with optimizations like Hermes engine.
  - Handles offline mode, local storage, and accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliance via libraries).
  - Easier for internationalization (i18n libraries) and RTL support.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - **Flutter**: Faster rendering and better battery optimization, but smaller ecosystem for OCR/encryption plugins and less mature for complex file operations (e.g., external backups). Use if prioritizing UI polish and performance benchmarks.
  - Native (Swift/Kotlin): Too costly for cross-platform; avoid unless you need ultra-low-level hardware integration.
- **Setup**: Use Expo for quick prototyping (managed workflow) or React Native CLI for full native control. Develop on Windows with Android Studio/iOS Simulator.

#### 2. **Programming Language: TypeScript**

- **Why?** Strongly typed JavaScript for better error handling, maintainability, and scalability (e.g., handling 10,000+ documents without degradation). Integrates seamlessly with React Native.

#### 3. **Local Database: SQLite (via react-native-sqlite-storage)**

- **Why?**
  - Stores metadata (e.g., categories, tags, version history, audit logs) locally and efficiently.
  - Supports encrypted storage and indexing for fast searches (<500ms for 10k docs).
  - Handles offline access and sync queues.
  - Complies with zero-knowledge encryption (user-specific keys).

#### 4. **File Storage & Management: React Native FS (RNFS) + Native Modules**

- **Why?**
  - Manages local file system for documents (e.g., PDFs, images).
  - Supports compression (lossless algorithms), deduplication, and secure wipe (overwrites with random bytes per NIST guidelines).
  - Integrates with external backups (USB, SD, HDD via native Android/iOS APIs) and wireless (WiFi/Bluetooth with user consent).
  - Handles device binding and integrity checks (SHA-256 hashes).

#### 5. **Encryption & Security: React Native Keychain + Crypto Libraries**

- **Why?**
  - **Key Management**: Uses device keystore (iOS Keychain/Android Keystore) for encryption keys, with PBKDF2-derived user keys for zero-knowledge storage.
  - **Data Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for files at rest/in transit; HMAC-SHA256 for integrity.
  - **MFA/Biometrics**: Integrates react-native-biometrics for fingerprint/face ID, plus TOTP/SMS via libraries like react-native-otp.
  - **Audit Logs**: Tamper-proof logs stored locally with timestamps.
  - Ensures compliance with GDPR/CCPA (e.g., data export/deletion, consent management).

#### 6. **OCR & Scanning: React Native ML Kit or Tesseract**

- **Why?**
  - Extracts text from scanned documents for auto-categorization and search.
  - Integrates with camera (react-native-image-picker or expo-camera) for real-time scanning.
  - Runs asynchronously in background to avoid UI blocking.

#### 7. **State Management: Redux Toolkit or Zustand**

- **Why?** Manages app state (e.g., user sessions, document lists) efficiently, with persistence for offline mode.

#### 8. **UI/UX Libraries: React Native Paper or NativeBase**

- **Why?** Provides customizable components for dashboards, previews, and accessibility (e.g., screen readers, high-contrast mode, keyboard navigation).
- Supports multi-language UI and RTL layouts.

#### 9. **Additional Libraries/Tools**

- **Sharing/Collaboration**: React Native NFC Manager for NFC/QR sharing; WebRTC for local network collaboration (peer-to-peer, no cloud).
- **Performance**: React Native Reanimated for smooth animations; optimize with code splitting and lazy loading.
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Detox for E2E; aligns with `testing_deployment.md`.
- **Build/Deployment**: Fastlane for CI/CD, Expo Application Services for app store submissions (ensures Apple/Google Play compliance).
- **Version Control**: Git with Git LFS for large files.

#### 10. **Backend (Minimal/Local-Only)**

- **Why?** No full backend needed since storage is local. For optional cloud sync/backups (user-enabled), use encrypted APIs (e.g., RESTful with JWT/OAuth2) hosted on a user-controlled server or P2P. Avoid unless required, per DEV-001.

### Why This Stack Fits the Requirements

- **Local-First**: All core features (storage, encryption, search) work offline without cloud dependency.
- **Security/Compliance**: Zero-knowledge encryption, MFA, biometric support, and audit logs meet SEC-001 to SEC-010 and LEG-001 to LEG-007.
- **Performance/Scalability**: Handles 10k+ documents with <500ms search, low RAM/battery usage (PERF-001 to PERF-011).
- **Features**: Supports OCR, scanning, bulk actions, versioning, previews, and secure backups (DOC-001 to DOC-010, DEV-002 to DEV-025).
- **Accessibility/Internationalization**: Multi-language, RTL, voice commands, keyboard nav (INT-001 to INT-006).
- **Sharing**: Local NFC/QR with encryption (SH-001 to SH-005).
- **Development Efficiency**: Cross-platform reduces costs; TypeScript ensures reliability.
- **Potential Challenges**: External device backups (e.g., USB) may need custom native modules; test thoroughly on devices.

### Next Steps

- **Prototype**: Start with Expo for a quick MVP (login, upload, scan).
- **Security Audit**: Use tools like OWASP for compliance.
- **Testing**: Focus on offline scenarios, encryption, and device compatibility.

I've successfully added a detailed folder structure section to the technical requirements document. Here's what was included:

### New Section 4: Folder Structure

- **Root-Level Structure**: Covers standard React Native folders like `android/`, `ios/`, `src/`, `__tests__/`, `assets/`, etc., with explanations.
- **src/ Folder Structure**: Feature-based organization (e.g., `components/`, `screens/`, `services/`, `store/`) to promote modularity and scalability.
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for modularity, separation of concerns, naming conventions, testing alignment, and version control.

The document now has the folder structure integrated, and I've renumbered the subsequent sections (Best Practices is now Section 5, Conclusion is Section 6) for consistency.

This structure follows React Native industry standards (e.g., Airbnb style guide) and best practices for maintainable, scalable apps, tailored to DocsShelf's needs (e.g., dedicated folders for `encryption/`, `ocr/`, `storage/`). You can review the updated file in your editor. If you'd like any adjustments or further details, let me know!

jmjoshi: create this folder structure under docsshelf root folder

GitHub Copilot: Perfect! I've created the complete folder structure under the `docsshelf` root folder based on the technical requirements document. All directories have been set up recursively, including:

- **Root-level folders**: android, ios, src, **tests**, e2e, assets (with subfolders `images/`, `fonts/`, `icons/`), node_modules, .expo
- **src/ subfolders**: `components/` (with `common/`, `forms/`, `ui/`), `screens/` (with `Auth/`, `Home/`, Documents, `Settings/`), `services/` (with `api/`, `database/`, `encryption/`, `ocr/`, `storage/`), `store/` (with `slices/`), `utils/` (with `constants/`, `helpers/`, `validators/`), `hooks/`, `types/`, `navigation/`, `i18n/` (with `locales/`), `config/`

This structure promotes modularity, scalability, and follows React Native best practices. Note that files like `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc., are not directories and would need to be created separately (e.g., via `npm init` or manual creation) when initializing the project.

You can now start adding code files to these folders. If you need any specific files created or further setup, let me know!
