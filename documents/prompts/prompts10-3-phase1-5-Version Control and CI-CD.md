GitHub Copilot: I have successfully implemented the Version Control and CI/CD requirements from the roadmap document, incorporating details from the technical requirements. Here's what has been set up:

## 1. GitHub Repository Setup

The GitHub repository is already properly configured as `docsshelf` under owner `jmjoshi` on the `master` branch.

## 2. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

Created a comprehensive CI workflow at ci.yml that:

- Runs on every push and pull request to the master branch
- Installs Node.js 18 and caches npm dependencies
- Performs linting using ESLint
- Runs TypeScript type checking
- Executes unit tests (framework ready, tests can be added later)

## 3. Fastlane Setup for Automated Builds

- Created Fastfile configured for React Native/Expo builds
- Uses Expo Application Services (EAS) for cross-platform builds
- Includes lanes for Android and iOS builds and app store submissions
- Installed EAS CLI as a development dependency

## 4. Project Configuration Updates

- Added npm scripts for `lint`, `typecheck`, and `test` in package.json
- Migrated ESLint configuration to the new flat config format (eslint.config.js) compatible with ESLint v9
- Maintained TypeScript strict mode and Prettier integration

## 5. Integration with Requirements

The setup aligns with the technical requirements document which specifies:

- Fastlane for CI/CD automation
- Expo Application Services for app store deployments
- Jest for unit testing (framework in place)
- Git with Git LFS for version control

The CI pipeline will now automatically check code quality on every commit, ensuring consistent linting and type safety. Fastlane is ready to automate builds and deployments once EAS profiles are configured for production releases.

All components are in place for Phase 1 completion, with the foundation set for scaling to full CI/CD in later phases.

Perfect! The linting now passes with no errors. Here's a summary of what we fixed:

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Line Ending Errors (969 → 0)**

- **Problem**: Files had Windows CRLF (`\r\n`) line endings, but Prettier expected LF (`\n`)
- **Solution**:
  - Added `"endOfLine": "lf"` to .prettierrc
  - Ran `npx prettier --write .` to fix all files

### 2. **ESLint Configuration**

- **Problem**: ESLint was checking generated Expo files in .expo directory
- **Solution**: Updated eslint.config.js to ignore `.expo/**` directory
- **Added**: `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` to global variables for React Native compatibility

### 3. **TypeScript Type Issues**

- **Problem**: Several `any` types and missing type definitions
- **Solutions**:
  - Created proper interfaces for navigation props in Login.tsx and Register.tsx
  - Updated `Document` interface in index.ts to match actual usage (string dates instead of Date objects)
  - Fixed FlatList item type in DocumentsList.tsx

### 4. **Unused Imports**

- **Problem**: `Text` component imported but not used in Home.tsx and SettingsMain.tsx
- **Solution**: Removed unused imports

## Current Status

✅ **Linting**: Passes with 0 errors  
✅ **TypeScript**: Compiles successfully  
✅ **CI Pipeline**: Ready to run on GitHub Actions

The codebase is now properly formatted and type-safe. Your GitHub Actions CI workflow will now run successfully on every push and pull request, ensuring code quality and catching issues early in the development process.
