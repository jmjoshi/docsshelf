I've created a comprehensive End-to-End Testing Guide for the DocsShelf mobile app. The document is now available at e2e_testing_guide.md and includes:

## Key Sections Covered:

1. **Prerequisites** - System requirements and project setup
2. **Detox Configuration** - Complete setup with config files, Jest configuration, and initialization
3. **Sample E2E Test** - Example test cases for core app functionality
4. **Simulator Testing**:
   - Android Emulator setup and testing
   - iOS Simulator setup and testing
   - Both with Detox and Expo alternatives
5. **Physical Device Testing**:
   - Android device setup, connection, and testing
   - iOS device setup, code signing, and testing
   - Installation procedures for both platforms
6. **App Packaging**:
   - Building APKs and AABs for Android
   - Building IPAs for iOS
   - Signing and distribution preparation
7. **Automated Test Suite** - Script for running tests across all configurations
8. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
9. **Best Practices** - Recommendations for test coverage and maintenance

The guide provides step-by-step instructions for every aspect of E2E testing, from initial setup through deployment on both simulators and physical devices for Android and iOS platforms. It includes both Detox-specific commands and Expo alternatives where applicable, ensuring compatibility with your Expo-based React Native project.
